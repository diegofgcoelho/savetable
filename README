This project contains the implementation of a method in different languages that saves your table (matrix) into text or latex format.
This is particularly useful in scientific application, saving you precious time and from typing everything every time you run your experiments.

This implementation was written by Diego Coelho, PhD student at University of Calgary.
The inprogress branch stores information and changes in the project related to the fast estimation of the largest eigenvalue of tridiagonal matrices before being committed to the master branch.
